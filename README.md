# clifs

Multi-platform command line interface for file system operations.

For installation run:

pip install clifs
```

After installation all functionality can be accessed typing `clifs` in the command line, which alone will show a list of installed plugins.

To implement your own plugin best inherit from the `clifs.ClifsPlugin` class.
